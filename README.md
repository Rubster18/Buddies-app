under the guidance of Juan Diego Calero https://www.linkedin.com/in/juandiegocalero/

the project has the purpose of serving as a medium of conecting patients and buddies (student volunteers) to help them in their treatment.

This app was built using React, the styles were made by compiling Sass.

The functionality is very simple, Buddies (student volunteers) register by presing the leftmost button on the homepage, patients register by pressing the other one.

After filling a simple form their data goes to the admin table and based on their preferences the admin makes a match between them.

Admin table is filled with all the registered information in a database built in postgresql.

Admin table rows are clickable prompting a modal to appear with selected person's information.
